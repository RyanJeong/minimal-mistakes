* 현재진행: **지금 현재 벌어지고 있는 동작**
    * Please be quite. I'<u>m working</u>.
    * Ryan <u>is writing</u> a letter.
    * The phone <u>is ringing</u>.

## 단순현재 vs. 현재진행 
* **permanent vs. temporary**
    * A: You <u>live</u> in Seoul, don't you?
    * B: I'<u>m living</u> with my parents for the moment.

    * I'<u>m seeing</u> Ryan tomorrow.

    * When Ryan comes, I <u>always meet</u> him at the station.

## always
