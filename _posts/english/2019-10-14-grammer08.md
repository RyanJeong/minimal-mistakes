## if절의 기본 속성
### 늘 항상 그럴 때(직설법)
* 일종의 진리, 습관, 일반적인 경향
    * If I <u>drink</u> coffee in the evening, I <u>can't</u> sleep at night.
    * If you <u>boil</u> water, it <u>changes</u> from a liquid to a gas.
    * If you <u>take</u> a fish out of water, it <u>dies</u>.

### 결과를 몰라서 추측할 경우
* if의 **가장 일반적인** 용법
* 과거에 대한 추측일 경우에는 if절 시제에 과거 동사, 비과거(현재 또는 미래)에 대한 추측일 경우에는 if절 시제에 현재 동사 사용
    * <u>If</u> I <u>offended</u> you, I apologize.
    * <u>If</u> he <u>takes</u> the antibiotics, he'll get better.
    * <u>If</u> you <u>come</u> tomorrow, we'll talk more.

### 사실의 반대를 가정할 경우
* 가정(가짜로 정하는)
* 과거 상황을 가정할 때는 if절 시제에 과거완료, 비과거(현재 또는 미래) 상황을 가정할 때는 if절 시제에 과거 동사 사용

    * <u>Would</u> you still <u>love</u> me if I <u>were</u> broke?

## 비과거의 세계
### 단순 추측

## 과거의 세계
### 단순 추측

    * 문맥을 통해 문장의 기준 시점이 과거인지 현재인지 구분할 줄 알아야 함
        * I missed my family, especially my mother, and I missed my other relatives, too. I wrote a lot of letters to my family, but still I couldn't fulfill the emptiness of my mind. I <u>expected</u> things <u>would</u> get better if I <u>made</u> new friends here, but it was not so easy.
        * Women <u>believed</u> if they <u>got</u> an advanced degree in business and <u>worked</u> hard they <u>could</u> become top managers of the company.

### 사실의 반대
* if절에 had + p.p.가 나오면 '과거 사실의 반대'
    * If the weather <u>had been</u> nice yesterday, I would have gone out.
* 가능성도 없는 동작, 상황, 다시 말해 확실하지도 않은 상황
    * 주절에 '덜 직선적'이고, '상황에 따라 유연하게 대처'할 수 있는 표현 사용
    * 주절에 사용되는 단어들
        * would: "~할 텐데, ~하려 했을 텐데" (현실은 아닌데)
        * could[would be able to]: "~할 수 있는데, ~할 수 있었을 텐데" (현실은 아닌데)
        * should[would have to]: "~해야 할 텐데, ~했어야 했는데" (현실은 아닌데)
        * might[probably would]: "~일지 모르는데, ~이었을지 모르는데" (현실은 아닌데)

## 혼합 가정
* if절의 내용은 '과거 사실의 반대'를 가정하고, 주절은 '현재 사실의 반대'를 쓰는 것

        It makes me want to cry<br>
        Could've been so beautiful<br>
        Could've been so right<br>
        Could've been my lover    

        * There is no 'would've should've could've'. Only did and didn't.
            > 
            이미 지나가버린 일을 놓고 이제 와서
            "(~했더라면) 그렇게 했을 거라는(I would've done it) 둥,
            그렇게 했어야 했다는(I shouldn't done it) 둥, 
            그렇게 할 수 있었을 거라는(I could've done it) 둥
            변명해봐야 소용없다. 결국 중요한 건 
            했느냐 안 했느냐다."

        * There are people who shoulda, coulda, woulda, And there are people who are glad they did.
